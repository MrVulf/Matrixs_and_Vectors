# Matrixs_and_Vectors
 
Matrix structure:
    IVECTOR(1): {v11, v12, ... , v1n}
    IVECTOR(2): {v21, v22, ...., v2n}
    ...
    IVECTOR(m): {vm1, vm2, ... , vmn}

The strategy of filling in the matrix:
    Stage 1: Fill in as a sparse matrix with sparse vectors.
        You must fill in every odd element in each vector
        Note: control the number of filled cells
        Note: If a matrix has only SpareVectors -> it is SpareMatrix
        Examples:
            |0|1|2|3|       |0|1|2|3|4|
            {0 ? 0 ?}       {0 ? 0 ? 0}  ---> this vectors are the SparseVectors for the build strategy
            {0 ? 0 ?}       {0 ? 0 ? 0}
            {0 ? 0 ?}       {0 ? 0 ? 0}
            {0 ? 0 ?}       {0 ? 0 ? 0}


    Stage 2: Fill in the remaining elements (not zero):
        Fill in the remaining cells until the number of allowed cells != 0
        Note: if the user tries to fill in the SpareMatrix with too many non-zero elements, an exception will appear.
        Examples:
            |0|1|2|3|       |0|1|2|3|4|
            {* ? * ?}       {* ? * ? *} ---> this vectors are the NormalVectors for the build strategy
            {* ? * ?}       {* ? * ? *}
            {* ? 0 ?}       {* ? * ? *}
            {0 ? 0 ?}       {* ? 0 ? 0}
